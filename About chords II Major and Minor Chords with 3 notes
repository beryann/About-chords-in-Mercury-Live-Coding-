//Basic chords Major, Minor with 3 notes 
//Comment or uncomment out the chord you wish to listen to.
//Copy and paste in Mercury!

//2 situations: with or without scale! The difference is subtle and will be more evident with more complex chords.

//set scale major c 

//list chd [[ 0 4 7 ]]
//new polySynth saw note(chd 1) time(1/4)

//set scale minor c 
//list chd [[ 0 3 or 4 7 ]]
//new polySynth saw note(chd 1) time(1/4)

//Or without set scale major or minor 
//set scale none 

//chord: c major
//list chd [[ 0 4 7 ]]
//new polySynth saw note(chd 1) time(1/4)

//Chord: c minor 
//list chd [[ 0 3 7 ]]
//new polySynth saw note(chd 1) time(1/4)

////////////////////////////////

//There 2 others possibilities to make these chords:

//The first one is very interesting because you add different modifications and effects for each note!
//Look at the 2nd one, the minor one: I have changed the synths, changed the time() for the root, added an effect fx() to the second note (3) and add the play() function to the quint (7) 
//We can do this with all the agreements that we will see afterwards.

//C major 
//new synth sine note(0 2) time(1/4)
//new synth sine note(4 2) time(1/4)
//new synth sine note(7 2) time(1/4)

//C minor 
//new synth sine note(0 2) time(1/8) 
//new synth saw note(3 2) time(1/4) fx(delay) 
//new synth triangle note(7 2) time(1/4) play(0.6)

//Last (but not at least!) the other possibility is with "chordsFromNumerals()", cf. tutorial 221 
//It is this example that I reeuse here: 

//list progression chordsFromNumerals([I IV V VIm])
//new polySynth sine note(progression 2) time(1/1) shape(1 3/4 1/4) 
//So you have here C [do mi sol], F [fa la do] , G |sol si re] and Am [la do mi] 
//And Timo Hoogland precises this: "It is also possible to add the 7, 9, 11 or 13th" So, It's what we'll see in the next tutorial.
