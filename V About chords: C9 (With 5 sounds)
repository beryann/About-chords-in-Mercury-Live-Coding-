//Copy and paste in Mercury!
//please comment and uncomment based on the chord you want to study

//The 3d chord of this list is: C9
//It has 4 notes [do mi sol sib re] and is also based on the C  major chord [do mi sol]
//It is very pleasant to hear and due to the re, it has a fuller and richer sound.

// C9 = [do mi sol sib re ]
//You have to set scale none

set scale none 
//list chd [[ 0 4 7 10 14 ]]
//new polySynth triangle note(chd 1) time(1/4) gain(1.1)

//////////////////// 

//Thus, if we refer to the previous tutorial, there are 2 other possibilities to achieve this chord.
//This way, as I said before, is very interesting since we can modify each note and affect different modifications and fx() for each note
//Change the synth, the time(), add an effect fx() for each note

//new synth sine note(0 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(4 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(7 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(10 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(14 2) time(1/4) 

//becomes this for instance 

//new synth saw note(0 1) time(1/16) fx(chorus) 
//new synth sine note(4 2) time(1/4) pan(random)
//new synth square note(7 2) shape(off) play(0.8) 
//new synth triangle note(10 2) time(1/4) fx(reverb 0.3 5) gain(1.1)
//new synth triangle note(14 2) time(1/2 1/16) fx(distort) gain(1.1)

////////////////////////////

//And the third possibility given by the tutorial 221 in the Mercury browser. I made here some adaptations to this tutorial to show you how it works

//list progression chordsFromNumerals([I9 III9 VI9 V9 ])
//new polySynth saw note(progression 2) time(1/1) shape(1 3/4 1/4)
