//Copy and paste in Mercury!
//please comment and uncomment based on the chord you want to study

//The 5th chord of this list is: CM11
//It has 6 notes [do mi sol si re fa] and is also based on the C  major chord [do mi sol]
//It's a fairly complex chord with a very rich sound. There is a version with fa# that is even richer, but we will only study the version with fa natural.

// CM11 = [do mi sol si re fa ]

//You have to set scale none

//set scale none 
//list chd [[ 0 4 7 11 14  17 ]]
//Try out with fa#
//list chd [[ 0 4 7 11 14  18 ]]
//new polySynth triangle note(chd 1) time(1/4) gain(1.1)

//////////////////// 

//Thus, if we refer to the previous tutorial, there are 2 other possibilities to achieve this chord.
//This way, as I said before, is very interesting since we can modify each note and affect different modifications and fx() for each note
//Change the synth, the time(), add an effect fx() for each note

//new synth sine note(0 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(4 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(7 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(11 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(14 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(17 2) time(1/4) 

//becomes this for instance 

//new synth saw note(0 1) time(1/2) shape(off) 
//new synth sine note(4 2) time(1/16) fx(delay)
//new synth square note(7 2) play(0.8) 
//new synth triangle note(11 2) time(1/4) fx(reverb 0.4 6) gain(1.1)
//new synth square note(14 2) time(1/2 1/8) shape(off) gain(0.6)
//new synth triangle note(17 2) time(1/4) fx(reverb 0.6 4) gain(1.2)

////////////////////////////

//And the third possibility given by the tutorial 221 in the Mercury browser but his time with that chord I think it doesn't work....

//list progression chordsFromNumerals([IM11 VIM11 ])
//new polySynth saw note(progression 2) time(1/1) shape(1 3/4 1/4) fx(reverb)
