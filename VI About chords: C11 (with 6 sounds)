//Copy and paste in Mercury!
//please comment and uncomment based on the chord you want to study

//The 4th chord of this list is: C11
//It has 6 notes [do mi sol sib re fa] and is also based on the C  major chord [do mi sol]
//It's a fairly complex chord with a very rich sound. There is a version with fa# that is even richer, but we will only study the version with fa natural.

// C11 = [do mi sol sib re fa ]

//You have to set scale none

//set scale none 
//list chd [[ 0 4 7 10 14  17 ]]
//new polySynth triangle note(chd 1) time(1/4) gain(1.1)

//////////////////// 

//Thus, if we refer to the previous tutorial, there are 2 other possibilities to achieve this chord.
//This way, as I said before, is very interesting since we can modify each note and affect different modifications and fx() for each note
//Change the synth, the time(), add an effect fx() for each note

//new synth sine note(0 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(4 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(7 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(10 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(14 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(17 2) time(1/4) 

//becomes this for instance 

//new synth saw note(0 1) time(1/16) shape(off) 
//new synth sine note(4 2) time(1/4) fx(vowel 0) 
//new synth square note(7 2) fx(lfo 1/16) play(0.8) 
//new synth triangle note(10 2) time(1/4) fx(reverb 0.3 5) gain(1.1)
//new synth square note(14 2) time(1/2 1/8) fx(distort) 
//new synth triangle note(17 2) time(1/2 1/32) fx(reverb 0.6 4) gain(1.2)

//And the third possibility given by the tuorial 221 in the Mercury browser. I made here some adaptations to this tutorial to show you how it works

//list progression chordsFromNumerals([I11 IV11 VI11 ])
//new polySynth saw note(progression 2) time(1/1) shape(1 3/4 1/4) fx(reverb)
