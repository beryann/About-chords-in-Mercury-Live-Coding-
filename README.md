Hello! This tutorial has two goals: to simply explain the basics of harmony because very often simple and precise information is sought by musicians or live coders who have not had the opportunity to receive solid training in harmony. The second goal is to enable these musicians/live coders to quickly and concretely use this information for their personal musical needs with Mercury Live Coding. 
Thank you for your patience as there are undoubtedly some inaccuracies here and there, and this is a 'work in progress. Other tutorials will come gradually. I sincerely hope they will help you in your live coding sessions with Mercury.
I am also discovering interesting ideas and things in harmony. And especially, thanks to Timo Hoogland for creating (and continuing to develop) this wonderful program called Mercury!
