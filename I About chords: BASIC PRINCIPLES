//Hello there! Work in progress!  

//1 BASIC PRINCIPLES

do= c re = D/d, mi = E/e, fa= F/f, sol = G/g, la = A/a, si = B/b Notes are used interchangeably with uppercase or lowercase letters.

//The basic principles are:a chord consists of at least 3 notes; otherwise, it is an interval! So, a powerchord like [ do sol] is just an interval!
//--> A major or minor chord is made up of 3 notes: a root, a third, and a fifth. It is major if the third is major and it is minor if the third is minor, that’s all.
//For example, C major is made up of the notes [C E G] and C minor is made up of [C E♭ G]. 
//Here we can clearly see that the third is different [eb], and it is this smaller third in the minor chord with the flat (1/2 tone lower) that makes the difference between major and minor.


//2 WHAT CHORDS ARE GOING TO STUDY?
//Here a list of basic chords with their sepcific notes we are going to see together and their realisation in Mercury
//The first note of the chord is the "root".To obtain chord inversions in music, change the root with an other note of the chord. But I am not sur that Mercuy makes the difference 


// C major = C [do mi sol]
// C7 = [do mi sol sib]
// CM7 or cmaj7= [do mi sol si]
// CM9 or cmaj9= [do mi sol si re] 


// C minor = Cm [do mib sol] 
// Cm7 or c min7 = [do mib sol sib] 
// Cm9 or cmin9 = [do mib sol sib re] 
// Cm11 or cmin11 = [do mib sol sib re fa] 


// C° or cdim = [do mib solb] 
// Caug or c+ = [do mi sol#]
// Csus2 = [do re sol]
// Csus4 = [do fa sol]
// Cadd2 = [do re mi sol]
// Cadd4 = [do mi fa sol] 
//A powerchord: a chord (an interval in fact) without the quint: C5 =[do sol]
//The random chords
