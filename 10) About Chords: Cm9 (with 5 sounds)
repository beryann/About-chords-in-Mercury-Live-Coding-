//Copy and paste in Mercury!
//please comment and uncomment based on the chord you want to study

//We are now going to study the chords classified 7, 9, and 11 based on the Cm chord [do mib sol] and we will continue now with Cm9.
//It's an interesting chord with a very rich sound. 

// Cm9 = [do mib sol sib re ]

//You have to set scale none

//set scale none 
//list chd [[ 0 3 7 10 14]]
///new polySynth triangle note(chd 1) time(1/4) gain(1.1)

//////////////////// 

//Thus, if we refer to the previous tutorial, there are 2 other possibilities to achieve this chord.
//This way, as I said before, is very interesting since we can modify each note and affect different modifications and fx() for each note
//Change the synth, the time(), add an effect fx() for each note

//new synth sine note(0 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(3 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(7 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(10 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(14 2) time(1/4) 

//becomes this for instance 

//new synth sine note(0 2) time(1/1) gain(1.3) fx(reverb 0.4 4)
//new synth sine note(3 2) time(3/8) fx(chorus)
//new synth sine note(7 2) time(7/6) pan(random)
//new synth sine note(10 2) time(1/16) 
//new synth sine note(14 2) time(12/15) 


////////////////////////////

//And the third possibility given by the tutorial 221 in the Mercury browser with "chordsFromNumerals" and it seems that it works correctly unlike the previous chord. 

//list progression chordsFromNumerals([Im9 Vm9 ])
//new polySynth saw note(progression 2) time(1/1) shape(1 3/4 1/4) fx(reverb)
