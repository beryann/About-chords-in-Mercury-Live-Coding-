//Copy and paste in Mercury!
//please comment and uncomment based on the chord you want to study

//We are now going to study the chords classified 7, 9, and 11 based on the Cm chord [do mib sol] and we will start with Cm7.
//It's an exciting chord with a very rich sound. 

// Cm7 = [do mib sol sib ]

//You have to set scale none

//set scale none 

//list chd [[ 0 3 7 10 ]]
//new polySynth triangle note(chd 1) time(1/4) gain(1.1)

//////////////////// 

//Thus, if we refer to the previous tutorial, there are 2 other possibilities to achieve this chord.
//This way, as I said before, is very interesting since we can modify each note and affect different modifications and fx() for each note
//Change the synth, the time(), add an effect fx() for each note

//new synth sine note(0 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(3 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(7 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(10 2) time(1/4) 

//becomes this for instance 

//new synth square note(0 2) time(1/4 1/16) 
//new synth triangle note(3 2) time(1/2) 
//new synth saw note(7 2) time(1/16) 
//new synth sine note(10 2) time(3/8) 

////////////////////////////

//And the third possibility given by the tutorial 221 in the Mercury browser. I made here some adaptations to this tutorial to show you how it works

//list progression chordsFromNumerals([Im7 Vm7 ])
//new polySynth saw note(progression 2) time(1/1) shape(1 3/4 1/4) fx(reverb)
