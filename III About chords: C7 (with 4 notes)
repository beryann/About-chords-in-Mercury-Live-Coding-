//Copy and paste in Mercury!
//please comment and uncomment based on the chord you want to study

//The 4 first chords we are going to see in our tutorials are based on a major chord f.i C major [do mi sol]

// C major = C [do mi sol]
// C7 = [do mi sol sib]
// CM7 or cMaj7= [do mi sol si]
// CM9 or cMaj9= [do mi sol si re]
// CM11 or cMaj9= [do mi sol si re fa]

//The first chord of this list is: C7 a very important chord in music discovered by the great composer Monteverdi! 
//We have already seen this chord C major which is the basis for building the C7, C9, C11, and C13. 
//this very important agreement in harmony. It is used on the V degree to create what is called a perfect cadence V-I (is it the right term?) for example.

// C7 = [do mi sol sib]
//You have to set scale none
//set scale none 
//list chd [[ 0 4 7 10 ]]
//new polySynth saw note(chd 1) time(1/4)

//////////////////// 

//Thus, if we refer to the previous tutorial, there are 2 other possibilities to achieve this chord.
//This way, as I said before, is very interesting since we can modify each note and affect different modifications and fx() for each note
//Change the synth, the time(), add an effect fx() for each note

//new synth sine note(0 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(4 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(7 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(10 2) time(1/4) 

////////////////////////////

//And the third possibility given by the tuorial 221 in the Mercury browser. I made here some adaptations to this tutorial to show you how it works
//These 3 7th chords are a classic chord progression in blues for example

//list progression chordsFromNumerals([I7 IV7 V7 ])
//new polySynth sine note(progression 2) time(1/1) shape(1 3/4 1/4) 

//So in the nex tutorial we'll Cm7 = [do mib sol sib]
