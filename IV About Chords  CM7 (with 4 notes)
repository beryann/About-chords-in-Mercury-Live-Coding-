//Copy and paste in Mercury!
//please comment and uncomment based on the chord you want to study

//The second chord of this list is: CM7
//It has 4 notes [do mi sol si] and is very based on the C chord [do mi sol]
//It sounds harder than the C7 because its seventh note is major.

// CM7 = [do mi sol si]
//You have to set scale none

//set scale none 
//list chd [[ 0 4 7 11 ]]
//new polySynth triangle note(chd 1) time(1/4) gain(1.1)

//////////////////// 

//Thus, if we refer to the previous tutorial, there are 2 other possibilities to achieve this chord.
//This way, as I said before, is very interesting since we can modify each note and affect different modifications and fx() for each note
//Change the synth, the time(), add an effect fx() for each note

//new synth sine note(0 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(4 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(7 2) time(1/4) 
//new synth sine note(11 2) time(1/4) 

//becomes this for instance 

//new synth saw note(0 2) time(1/8) fx(lfo) 
//new synth sine note(4 2) time(1/4) pan(random)
//new synth square note(7 2) time(1/16) play(0.8) fx(lfo 1/16)
//new synth triangle note(11 2) time(1/2) fx(reverb) gain(1.1)

////////////////////////////

//And the third possibility given by the tuorial 221 in the Mercury browser. I made here some adaptations to this tutorial to show you how it works

//list progression chordsFromNumerals([IM7 VM7 ])
//new polySynth saw note(progression 2) time(1/1) shape(1 3/4 1/4)
